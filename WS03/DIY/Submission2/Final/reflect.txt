my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

a) What have you learned in terms of programming topics? (first paragraph)
Through this workshop, I learned about member functions query and modifier. 
These are the public members of the class, and query is a function used to access private members without any change. 
The reason for using this is that external functions are not accessible to private member variables, so queries are used to access private members in the class.
For example,
    bool Bar::isValid() const
    {
        return b_title && b_title[0] != '\0' && b_sampleVal >= 0 && b_sampleVal <= 100;
    }
The 'isValid' function above is a function of checking whether these variables are valid using Bar's private members, b_title, b_fillChar, and b_sampleVal.
I wrote 'const' in the function prototype because I would not make any changes to these variables.

On the other hand, 'const' was not used in the variable 'setEmpty' to set private member variables to empty state.
    void Bar::setEmpty()
    {
        b_title[0] = '\0';
        b_fillChar = '\0';
        b_sampleVal = -1;
    }
These member functions are called modifiers because the values are changed to set the above variables to empty state.

b) What errors have you debugged? (second paragraph)
